<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Angel Celaya, I was born in Phoenix, AZ; I have always fancied working with my hands. Whether that be my 
  love for finger foods, my deep connection with  writing and literature or simply my current work as an RPA Developer. I have also done some construction
  in my past life, and have always had a deep interest in puzzles of all kinds. I have garnerd 
  curiosity about learning to build websites and coding of all kinds over the last few years. I mean who hasn't seen any 90's movie about hacking
  and wasn't left enamored by the capabilites of code.</p>

<p>Currently I am working my way through various bootcamps and courses in order to obtain certifications and vast knowledge 
  within the tech industry in order to broaden my horizens and discover how far I want to take my career in IT.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I am just an Ordinary 29 year old male, enjoying the time I have in this world. In addtion to the things 
  I have already listed, I enjoy a good slice of pizza in combonation with a nice order of saucy wings. My current residence
  resides in Glendale, Az, and I have worked an in RPA for 4 years. I have been known to be quite the movie buff, I appreciate 
  spending time playing videogames and am for better or worse quite the family man. For anything else please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
